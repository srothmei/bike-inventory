Write a web app which I can use to manage the inventory of bike parts in my garage. I want to search the inventory to different items for certain categories of bike parts (e.g. brakes, frame, tires etc.).
Items should ba able to be stored with a title, a GTIN number (derived from their packaging barcode) and a image.
There should be a Barcode scanner which enables me to quickly add new items via using my iPhone camera to scan the barcodes. Also this feature should enable me to scan a barcode to find the entry in my inventory database.
This should be a web app running in the browser and hosted on my local network using docker compose.
The web app needs to be accessed via https in order to make the camera input work on ios.
Feel free to use the best programming language for this task.
THe app need to work on iPhones and computers (safari browser)
